# Developer's Guide for the Intercom iOS SDK

## Requirements
The Intercom iOS SDK currently supports iOS 7.x although we plan to support iOS 8 once itâ€™s out of beta.

## Quick Install
- Add `Intercom.h` and `libIntercom.a` to your Xcode project (you can get them from [github](https://github.com/intercom/intercom-ios)). In your build target, include the `-ObjC` flag under `Other Linker Flags`.
- You'll need your Intercom App Id and the SDK API key. You can get them from your [Intercom App Settings](https://app.intercom.io/) -> API keys 
- Initialize Intercom by calling:
`[Intercom setApiKey:@"ios_sdk-..." forAppId:@"your_app_id"];`
- Start a session by either calling
`[Intercom beginSessionForUserWithEmail:self.userEmail completion:nil];`
or
`[Intercom beginSessionForUserWithUserId:self.userId completion:nil];`
And that's it.

## Logging
By default the Intercom iOS SDK only logs errors. By calling the class method `enableLogging`, you can increase the log level. It is recommended to use this only for debugging purposes, not the App Store build.
